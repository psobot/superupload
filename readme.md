Superupload
====================
A spiffy node.js & Javascript-based file uploader by Peter Sobot.

July 8 & 9, 2011. http://www.petersobot.com/

Simple Startup:
---------------
> ./startServer.sh

Much more complex startup:
--------------------------
> node superupload.js

Superupload makes use of one useful Node helper library: formidable, to handle the upload chunks without too much fuss.
(And of course, jQuery in the front-end for a little bit of nice GUI animation.)
